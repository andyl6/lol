    <h3>My personal thoughts</h3>
    <p>NYC is a pretty nice place to go. There's a lot of places to eat, most attractions in my opinion are for tourists. The Edge is an example, but that place is infested with red lantern flies so it's really ugly. I haven't really gone past Times Square but I have been to some nice food spots and whatnot. It's somewhat dangerous at night because that is when most weird people and rats come out (ktown), but it is also quite nice at night. Karaoke, eating out with friends, and Times Square are all nice places in the night. But there are also places like museums and parks if you are that type of person. I personally enjoy drinking so I mostly know places to go out to eat and whatnot. The only real issues are transit problems and that most of the interesting stuff is in Manhattan. But, NY is also near some nice places like American Dream in NJ and Round 1 Arcade a few cities to the right. It's near some colleges too. Other than that, I think NYC is a nice place to visit and has a good amount of things to do.</p>
